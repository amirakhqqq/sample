Git considers each commit change point or "save point". It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.
When we commit, we should always include a message.

$ git commit -m "First release of Hello World!"
this a  direct commit without staging , comiting without staging is not recommended
git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"
